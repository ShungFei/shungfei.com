I've built a static site using [Astro](https://astro.build) to house my:

-   Professional profile
-   Projects
-   and maybe a blog in the future?

I always thought it was kind of egotistical to have your own site. And maybe it is!

But I canâ€™t help but feel just a little happy to look back and see how far Iâ€™ve come.

Letâ€™s put something cooler here next time!

## Template

This website was created using the [Astro Starter Kit: Portfolio](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/portfolio) theme [under the MIT License](./COPYRIGHT.txt)

This template is pretty new as of writing, but depending on how many others use it in the future this site might end up looking very clichÃ©!

But the theme is still quite pretty, so I hope you'll enjoy your stay nonetheless.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Deployment

Currently hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)

## Roadmap

-   Create a blog!
    -   It would be nice to be able to search the blog like in https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/
-   A gallery for my artwork, perhaps?
-   Dig through my files and find some more interesting stuff to show
