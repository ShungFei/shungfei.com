## A record for the future me

I always thought it was a little egotistical to have your own site. And maybe it is!

But I can't help but feel just a little happy to look back and see how far I've come.

Let's put something cooler here next time!

Check out the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShungFei/shungfei.com)

## Template

This website was created using the [Astro Starter Kit: Portfolio](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/portfolio) theme [under the MIT License](./COPYRIGHT.txt)

This template is pretty new as of writing, but depending on how many others use it in the future this site might end up looking very clich√©!

But the theme is still quite pretty, so I hope you'll enjoy your stay nonetheless.

## Deployment

Currently hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)

## Roadmap

-   Create a blog!
    -   It would be nice to be able to search the blog like in https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/
-   A gallery for my artwork, perhaps?
-   Dig through my files and find some more interesting stuff to show
