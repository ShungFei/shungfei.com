## 3, 2, 1, Let's Jam!

Made in 48 hours for [Kiwijam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/kiwijam23) together with [Jono Shields](https://jonoshields.com/).

-   Source code (MIT) at https://github.com/foopod/window-drag

This may be _my_ first jam, but Jono has an incredible portfolio full of cool stuff â€” including a write-up about [their other game during the jam](https://foopod.itch.io/a-thriving-community). Please do check out it!

### Fun Facts

![Placeholder alt text](/assets/projects/window-drag/windowdrag1.gif)

Our game was made (almost) entirely using free and open source software.
We used Godot, Libresprite, etc on laptops running Linux.

Game development has come a long way since the era we're invoking. We absolutely would not have been able to build this in 2 days with tools from the 2000s!

### Please do enjoy the game!

It's definitely much better played than just watched :)
