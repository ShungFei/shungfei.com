## Hey Wotsar, take me home

> ...country roads?

My first project at university was a really fun one! It's nice to be given free reign to dream up our wildest inventions.

And hey, maybe something like Wotsar will really exist one day â€” who can say?

### The Assignment

The average life expectancy in New Zealand is increasing. Given the increasing elderly population, it's important to address the issues that arise due to old age like the decline in mental health and wellbeing.

Your design will address the
issue of independent living, specifically mobility and accessibility e.g. local travel,
climbing stairs etc.
